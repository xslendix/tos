To get a VM working, first you need to make sure you have QEMU installed
and that you are working inside a \*NIX enviroment such as GNU/Linux.

After you made sure that you have the right prerequisites, you can now
start/create a VM using `./tos.sh run`, or if you wish to use VNC, use
`./tos.sh vnc`
